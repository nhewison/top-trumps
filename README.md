# Nat’s Game “Movie Top Trumps”. 

## About

This is my final project for the 10 week part time JavaScript course I have completed with General Assembly. 

It is an interactive game, based on the family-favourite card game “Top Trumps”, using The Movie Database API. 

Built with JavaScript and React. 

Play the game here: https://nhewison.github.io/top-trumps/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to play:

* Read your movie card. 
* Select the attribute you think will beat the computers card. 
* See if you won! 🎉
* Play again to play another round. 

### Tips:
* The earlier the release date, the better. 
* The higher the revenue, the better etc. 
* If you beat the other card, you win. 
* If you tie or lose, you play again. 

Enjoy.
